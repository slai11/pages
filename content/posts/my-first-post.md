On my last day at Viki, I bought a cup of ice latte from the very cafe where my
director spoke to me and tried to find out which team I would have fit best in.
He proposed the SRE team since I had expressed a deep interest in performance
and scaling infrastructure components. However, I politely declined as
I preferred to build up "proper" foundation as an SWE by building components of
a distributed system.

Outcome? I was given the role of SWE in the multimedia team and proceeded to do
just that over the next ~2.5 years, building components to support a playback architecture which was
distributed(available) and robust to failures. 

Thinking back, I wondered if I had taken the SRE role, would I have taken up my
offer at my next gig in their platform infrastructure team.
